# Try-Markdown

Experimenting with Markdown documents. You can make text **bold** by enclosing it in double-asterix, or you can make it *italic* by enslosing it in single-asterix.

You can identify a short in-line code snippet by enclosing it in single-back-tic characters, like so: `git init`.

You can also create lists by using the single dash followed by a space for each line of text. So far, we've covered

- **bold** text
- *italic* text
 - some `code` samples
 - simple lists
